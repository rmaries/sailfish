File naming and organization convention:
- files containing kernels for specific LB models should be
  in the models/ subdirectory
- main template files (used as kernel_file in the simulation class)
  should be in the models/ subdirectory and should start with the
  prefix 'lb_'
- files containing mainly kernel code should start with the
  prefix 'kernel_'
