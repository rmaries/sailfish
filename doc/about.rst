Development team
----------------
The Sailfish project was started by Michal Januszewski and is currently developed by a group
of contributors.  See the git commit logs for a full list of authors.

How to help?
------------

* Join the project mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/sailfish-cfd and help
  other users.

* Send us patches implementing new functionality, fixing bugs or adding new test cases.
  Patches should be sent in the form of merge requests on `GitHub <https://raw.github.com/sailfish-team/sailfish>`_.

* Don't know what to start with?  Not a problem!  Just ping us on the mailing list and
  we would be happy to provide ideas.

Note that you don't need to be a physicist or engineer to be able to provide useful help.
We have a number of things that we would like to do within the project that only
require basic programming skills but which would nevertheless be very helpful to us.
If you want to help but are not sure how, please contact us on the *sailfish-cfd*
mailing list.
